Experiments with the Crosswire Sword API library.
To get the library and the Python bindings compiled on Linux, you basically need the following steps:

# For wxPython on Mint
# sudo apt install libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libnotify-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libsdl1.2-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev  
# sudo apt-get install python3-distutils python3-distutils-extra python3-apt libpython3.7-dev 
# sudo pip3 install python-config 
# sudo pip3 install wxpython  

# Prerequisite for Sword is SWIG which in turn needs PCRE
# sudo apt install build-essential autotools-dev pkg-config libz-dev libclucene-dev libicu-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libtool m4 automake bison

# First we need to download and compile PCRE2. 
# Download and unzip from here: https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/releases  
# cd into the unzipped dir and use the normal Linux build cycle:
# ./configure 
# make 
# sudo make install 

# In some environments I used sudo also for ./configure and make because of error messages with file rights

# For SWIG, download the tar file, build and install it. 
# https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swig/swig-4.0.2/swig-4.0.2.tar.gz/download  
# ./autogen.sh 
# ./configure 
# make 
# sudo make install 

# download and unzip http://crosswire.org/ftpmirror/pub/sword/source/v1.9/sword-1.9.0.tar.gz
# ./autogen.sh 
# ./configure 
# make 
# sudo make install 

# Now to compile the Python bindings in Sword... 
# From the Sword base directory where the .tar.gz file was extracted, 
# cd bindings/swig/package 
# libtoolize --force 
# ./autogen.sh 
# ./configure 
# make pythonswig 

# At this point I made some changes to ...bindings/swig/package/Makefile for Python3
# Line 931 change $(PYTHON) to python3
# Line 944 ff change command to subprocess, has_key() to __contains__() and iteritems() to items()
# Altogether 5 lines changed.
# make python_make 

# sudo make install did not work properly, so I manually copied the build results
# sudo cp /home/michael/Downloads/sword-1.9.0/lib/.libs/libsword* /lib 
# sudo cp /home/michael/Downloads/sword-1.9.0/bindings/swig/package/python/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.10/_Sword.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages 

# I also managed to compile this on a Raspberry Pi 4 / Raspbian Bullseye
# There I copied _Sword.cpython-39-arm-linux-gnueabihf.so from ...Python/build/ to /lib/python3/dist-packages

# Have fun!
