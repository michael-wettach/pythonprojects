Experiments with the Raspberry Pi Zero.

Even the Zero 1, though it has a relatively slow processor, can run a full linux installation.
Keep in mind that using the graphical desktop is not much fun; command line is preferable.
I have found that I quite like the command line editor Micro and can recommend it,
especially working through SSH in a terminal session from another computer.

The Zero 2 is a different story; it can work quite well with a low-weight X desktop.
