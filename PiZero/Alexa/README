There is a Python library fauxmo on Github that allows the Pi Zero to be recognized as an Alexa compatible device.

This German web page has instructions on how to install it:
https://itler.net/raspberry-pi-mit-alexa-amazon-echo-steuern-anleitung/ 

But the fauxmo docs also have such instructions.

In my example use case, I want to control a motor-driven slatted frame.
There are 2 motors with 4 directions:
* move top section (head) up or down
* move bottom section (legs/feet) up or down

So I had to create 4 switches which can be turned on and off with Alexa.
I adapted the necessary configuration files mentioned in the article  
and added some code to manage status information in the form of files.
* file exists means the corresponding switch status is "on"
* file does not exist means the corresponding switch is "off".

This allows for easy status checking wih a small batch script.
The script has to return 0 for "device is on" and <>0 for "device is off".

I created a service as suggested in the fauxmo docs 
and used systemd to automatically start the Alexa client after reboot.
